Varnish GeoIP Module
---------------------------

:Author: Lee Doolan

SYNOPSIS
========

import geoip;

DESCRIPTION
===========

This Varnish module lets you add VCL that sets the request header 
X-GeoIP to the requestor's geo (or Unknown).

Requires GeoIP library (on Debian install libgeoip-dev)

INSTALLATION
============

The source tree is based on autotools to configure the building, and
does also have the necessary bits in place to do functional unit tests
using the varnishtest tool.

Install the GeoIP library headers::

 apt-get install libgeoip-dev

To check out the current development source::

 git clone git://github.com/leed25d/geoip-vmod.git
 cd geoip-vmod; ./autogen.sh

Usage:

./configure VARNISHSRC=DIR

VARNISHSRC is the directory of the Varnish source tree for which to
compile your vmod. Both the VARNISHSRC and VARNISHSRC/include
will be added to the include search paths for your module.

Make targets:
    make - builds the vmod
    make install - installs your vmod in VMODDIR
    make check - runs the unit tests in src/tests/*.vtc

In your VCL you could then use this vmod like the following. This
sets the request header X-GeoIP to the requestor's geo (or Unknown).
    ,----
    | import geoip;
    |
    | sub vcl_recv {
    |     set req.http.X-Forwarded-For = client.ip;
    |     set req.http.X-GeoIP = geoip.country(req.http.X-Forwarded-For)
    | }
